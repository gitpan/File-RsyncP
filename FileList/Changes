0.47 Sun Mar 14 21:37:22 PST 2004

  - Changed FileList/FileList.xs so that uid, gid, mode and mtime
    are forced to be unsigned.  This fixes a problem new to 0.46 that
    was introduced when newSVuv was replaced with newSVnv to back

0.45 Sat Feb  7 15:37:51 PST 2004

  - Patch from Marlin Prowell for FileList/flist.c that solves a
    subtle file list corruption problem.  In particular, f->lastdir
    was being set too early in receive_file_entry(), potentially
    before it returned to fetch more data and restart.

  - Patches from Lars Thegler to back port to perl 5.005_03.
