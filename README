File::RsyncP
============

Version 0.70, released 25 Jul 2010.

File::RsyncP is a perl implementation of an Rsync client.  It is
compatible with Rsync 2.x (protocol versions up to 28).  It can send
or receive files, either by running rsync on the remote machine, or
connecting to an rsyncd deamon on the remote machine.

What use is File::RsyncP?  The main purpose is that File::RsyncP
seperates all file system I/O into a seperate module, which can
be replaced by any module of your own design.  This allows rsync 
interfaces to non-filesystem data types (eg: databases) to be
developed with relative ease.

File::RsyncP was initially written to provide an Rsync interface
for BackupPC, L<http://backuppc.sourceforge.net>.  See BackupPC
for programming examples.

File::RsyncP does not yet provide a command-line interface that
mimics native Rsync.  Instead it provides an API that makes it
possible to write simple scripts that talk to rsync or rsyncd.

The File::RsyncP::FileIO module contains the default file system access
functions.  File::RsyncP::FileIO may be subclassed or replaced by a
custom module to provide access to non-filesystem data types.

INSTALLATION
